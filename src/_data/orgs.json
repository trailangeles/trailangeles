At the same time, we provide a degree of training while working in the field, affording High School and College students, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, and everyone else, get introduced to methods and best practices. We hope that volunteers who come out from time to time acquire comfortable skills which allows them to mention their volunteer work on their employment resumes. We provide work hours for people who must perform Community Service, and we assist Boy Scout Eagle Scout candidates with potential projects.",
